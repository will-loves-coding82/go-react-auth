# Go Auth Server

A lightweight go server that handles OAuth login flows and database retrieval. I was motivated by my internship work to figure out how to create a fullstack approach to open authorization work flows. To help speed up development, I used [goblueprint](https://github.com/Melkeydev/go-blueprint) to create a boilerplate infrastructure. To see the client application visit this [repository](https://github.com/GoAuthExample/go-auth-client-app)


## Features

* Chi Router for routing capabilities
* Open Authorization (with Google as an Identity Provider) using the  [markbates/goth](https://github.com/markbates/goth?tab=readme-ov-file) package
* Database service (MySQL) for storing user IdP data
* Dockerized development environement


## Workflow




1. A client navigates to the `auth/{provider}/callback`  endpoint in the browser url

   
   1. They must use **google** as the provider name
2. Server calls the [goth](https://github.com/markbates/goth?tab=readme-ov-file) method `CompleteUserAuth()` to begin the Open Authorization step with google sign in

   
   1. The OAuth screen returns back to the server endpoint with the Gothic user data
   2. Gothic user data is then saved into the DB if it doesn’t exist already
   3. A new gothic session is created in a cookie store stored on the server

      
      1. The session ID will also be saved in the client browser cookies
   4. The endpoint will then redirect the user to <http://localhost:8080/dashboard>
3. Client app refreshes upon redirecting

   
   1. The refresh will fetch the user’s data from the DB to display on the dashboard
4. If the user logs out, they send an HTTP request to `auth/logout` which will invalidate the session cookie using the cookie metadata attached in the request’s headers

   
   1. If the logout response status is “ok”, the client app will return back the login page
   2. You will also notice that the client’s session cookie is also deleted

## Project Structure

* cmd/main.go - entry point that creates the server and gothic store
* pkg/ - defines app packages
  * auth/ - initializes the gothic store for sessions & sets up the google provider
  * database/ - defines DB interactions and methods
  * responses/ - defines reusable types and functions for rendering HTTP responses
  * server/ - route handling and OAuth flows + callbacks
  * scripts/ - contains an SQL file for seeding the database
* docker-compose.yml - spins up the MySQL db container image
* .air.toml - builds the app by running `make build` and provides hot reloading/watching when changes are made
* Makefile - commands to build, run, watch, test the application


## Environment Configuration

Values in the `example.env` file are used to run the service. A select number of these variables can be overriden:

* `SESSION_SECRET`: Used to initialize the gothic cookie store (can be any string for now, but this should ideally be a unique randomly generated key)
* `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`  - These are generated when you create Google OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform


> Make sure to rename example.env to .env



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### MakeFile

Run build make command with tests

```bash
make all
```

Build the application

```bash
make build
```

Run the application

```bash
make run
```

Create DB container

```bash
make docker-run
```

Shutdown DB Container

```bash
make docker-down
```

DB Integrations Test:

```bash
make itest
```

Live reload the application:

```bash
make watch
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
make test
```

Clean up binary from the last build:

```bash
make clean
```



### Manual Set up

This is if you want to avoid using the commands found in the make file

```bash
docker compose down -v # remove volumes from mysql container
docker compose up      # spin up the mysql container and initialize the DB
```


```bash
# Make sure to set the GO environment variable 
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin

# Start the app server
air
```
